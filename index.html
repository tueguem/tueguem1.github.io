  <div class="container zone">The sport of soccer (called football in most of the world) is considered to be the world's most popular sport. In soccer there are two teams of eleven players. Soccer is played on a large grass field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to get the soccer ball into the opposing team's goal. The key to soccer is that, with the exception of the goalie, players cannot touch the ball with their hands, they can only kick, knee, or head the ball to advance it or score a goal.</div>

  <h1>About Eto'o</h1>
  <pre><img src="cameroon.jpg"
         alt="The legend" style="float: left;">
    After over twenty years as a player, 
    Samuel Eto’o has announced his retirement. 
    Eto’o played for 11 teams and won 18 club 
    and national team trophies and numerous 
    individual awards. He scored 426 goals in
    877 matches and retires holding the record 
    for the most goals goals in the African Cup 
    of Nations and is Cameroon’s all-time leading scorer.
    He is one of the best players that Africa has 
    ever produced and one of the truly great strikers
    of the 21st century. He had pace and strength, 
    he was a tremendous finisher from short-range 
    and from distance, and he was just as likely 
    to create a chance as he was to score a goal.
